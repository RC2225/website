## Tier

fluxcd is what we call a "Tier 2" deployment options.
This means that we expect it to work smoothly, all options being technically available and we've enough staff available to help-out.

With Tier 2 options, you should not have to expect issues caused by the deployment option.

## How to Configure

Configuration should be done "The Helm Way" via editing HelmRelease objects in the git repository.
Values of which can be used like normal on helm.

This can be done following the [Helm Guides](/general/)

and checking all the many options available in our [Common Library Chart](/common/)
